## Project Description


  For my project, I wanted to create something that would help to develop my skills in [React](https://reactjs.org/).
I chose to create a recreate the functionality of a Youtube site and to use the Youtube data api in order to access videos for my users. This was a great practice in using multiple components within a single React application, and really helped to develop my skills in other areas such as passing data down and actions up. I learned a lot about using and applying state within my app. Setting state was crucial for many of the functions of this application, especially the searchbar and the video list. State was used to update and render new lists based on the searchbar input, and also used to display and play selected videos that were clicked from the list.
I got to practice with passing down data and actions up through mutiple components as well.
